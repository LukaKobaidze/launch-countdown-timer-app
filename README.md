## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I got better at working with svgs, learned how to style them the way i want. Also got better at TypeScript, this was my first time using TypeScript with React in a project and this was a good practice. I learned how to make card flip from the middle, which was the most difficult part of this challenge, after lot of experiments I finally implemented it and I'm really happy about it.
